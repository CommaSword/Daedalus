 - The top section between the two triple-dashes (`---`) is metadata in [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) format. 
 - The list of fields in the metadata is still subject to change. 
 - The name field is something we already know is mandatory.
 - The name has to be a unique ID and be as relevant as possible to the document. This is the name of the data entry as will be displayed to the users before opening the file.
 - The rest of the document (after the second `---` ) is the entry's body, it should be written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
