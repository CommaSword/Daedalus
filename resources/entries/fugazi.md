# F.U.G.A.Z.I
Fiat Utterance Gateway Application (zero interface).

The ship’s operations console, which acts as a gateway between a human operator and the ship’s subsystems. In order to save an hour’s work, we’ve decided to name the in-game system Fugazi, just like [the platform it's written on](https://fugazi-io.github.io/docs/#/?id=fugaziio). 

## What’s Fugazi-io
Fugazi-io is an open source application for pluggable and extendable command line in the web.
Fugazi-io has an [online demo](http://fugazi.io/), a [github project](https://github.com/fugazi-io/webclient) and a [documentation site](https://fugazi-io.github.io/docs/#/?id=fugaziio). It’s written in Typescript and runs on React.

## What’s F.U.G.A.Z.I
We use Fugazi-io in the game to implement the ship’s operations console, which acts as a gateway between a human operator and the ship’s subsystems. In order to save an hour’s work, we’ve decided to name the in-game system Fugazi as well. We’ll refer to the off-game application as Fugazi-io and to the ship’s in-game system as Fugazi.
