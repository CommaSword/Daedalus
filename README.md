# Daedalus
Empty Epsilon extension.

This project extends the [Empty Epsilon](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/) spaceship bridge simulator game,
by simulating the spaceship's need for [Maintenance, Repair and Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair_and_operations) during the game.

## Core concept
Daedalus replaces the singular auto-repair screen with a simulation of the ship's several sub-systems engineering interfaces.
